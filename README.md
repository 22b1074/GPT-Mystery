In week 1 file  primary focus is on implementing basic backpropagation for a neural network using Python.
In Week 2 file i implemented a Trigram model using PyTorch, incorporating regularization, cross-entropy loss, softmax loss, and supporting both one-hot encoding and indexing encoding methods, with names.txt as input data set
