In week 1 file  primary focus is on implementing basic backpropagation for a neural network using Python.
In Week 2 file i implemented a Trigram model using PyTorch, incorporating regularization, cross-entropy loss, softmax loss, and supporting both one-hot encoding and indexing encoding methods, with names.txt as input data set
In week3 file i implemented uniform intialization and batch normalization
In week4 file i trained a model to predict sum of two 3 digit numbers(i mean 012 also).
